## üìã Audit Module (Core Feature)

### Create Audit
```http
POST /audits
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "month": 10,
  "year": 2025,
  "notes": "October 2025 Audit",
  "conducted_by": "uuid-of-user"
}
```

**Key Feature:** 
- Automatically creates audit records for **ALL existing inventory items**
- All values (recorded_current, recorded_active, recorded_broken, recorded_inactive) start at **0**
- Users then update these values during the audit process
- Each month creates a fresh audit with values reset to 0

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Audit created successfully with 150 records!",
  "data": {
    "audit": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "month": 10,
      "year": 2025,
      "status": "in_progress",
      "notes": "October 2025 Audit",
      "conducted_by": "uuid-of-user"
    },
    "auditRecords": [...],
    "totalRecords": 150
  }
}
```

### Get All Audits
```http
GET /audits
```

### Get Audit by ID (with all records grouped by room)
```http
GET /audits/{audit_id}
```

### Update Audit
```http
PATCH /audits/{audit_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "in_progress",
  "notes": "Updated notes",
  "conducted_by": "uuid-of-user"
}
```
**Valid status values:** `in_progress`, `completed`, `reviewed`

### Complete Audit (Updates Inventory with Recorded Values)
```http
PATCH /audits/{audit_id}/complete
```

**Key Feature:**
- Marks the audit as completed
- Updates all inventory records with the values recorded during the audit
- Inventory quantities are updated based on audit findings

### Delete Audit
```http
DELETE /audits/{audit_id}
```
**Note:** Can only delete audits with status `in_progress`

---

## üìù Audit Record Module (Update Values)

### Get Audit Record by ID
```http
GET /audit-records/{record_id}
```

### Get All Audit Records by Audit ID
```http
GET /audit-records/audit/{audit_id}
```

### Update Audit Record (Single)
```http
PATCH /audit-records/{record_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "recorded_current": 48,
  "recorded_active": 45,
  "recorded_broken": 2,
  "recorded_inactive": 1,
  "notes": "Item inspection notes"
}
```

**Key Feature:**
- This is where users **add values** during the audit
- Values start at 0 when audit is created
- Users update these values as they inspect items
- Can only update if audit status is `in_progress`

### Bulk Update Audit Records
```http
PATCH /audit-records/bulk
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "records": [
    {
      "id": "record-uuid-1",
      "recorded_current": 48,
      "recorded_active": 45,
      "recorded_broken": 2,
      "recorded_inactive": 1
    },
    {
      "id": "record-uuid-2",
      "recorded_current": 30,
      "recorded_active": 28,
      "recorded_broken": 1,
      "recorded_inactive": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Feature:**

}
```

## üîÑ Typical Workflow

### 1. Setup Phase (One-time)
```
1. Create Rooms ‚Üí POST /rooms
2. Create Items ‚Üí POST /items
3. Create Inventory for all rooms ‚Üí POST /inventories/bulk (for each room)
```

### 2. Monthly Audit Process

#### Step 1: Create New Audit
```http
POST /audits
{
  "month": 10,
  "year": 2025,
  "conducted_by": "user-uuid"
}
```
‚úÖ **System automatically creates audit records for ALL inventory items with values = 0**

#### Step 2: Update Audit Records (During Inspection)
```http
PATCH /audit-records/{record_id}
{
  "recorded_current": 50,
  "recorded_active": 48,
  "recorded_broken": 1,
  "recorded_inactive": 1,
  "notes": "Checked on 2025-10-15"
}
```
‚úÖ **Users add actual values as they inspect items**

#### Step 3: Complete Audit
```http
PATCH /audits/{audit_id}/complete
```
‚úÖ **System updates inventory with the recorded values**

### 3. Next Month
```
Create new audit ‚Üí Same process, all values reset to 0 again
```

## üìä Data Models Overview

### Audit Status Flow
```
in_progress ‚Üí completed ‚Üí reviewed
```

### Inventory vs Audit Records
- **Inventory**: Master record of room-item combinations (permanent)
  - Stores current totals
  - Updated when audit is completed

- **Audit Records**: Snapshot for specific audit period
  - Created fresh each month with values = 0
  - Users fill in values during audit
  - Multiple audit records exist per inventory (one per audit)

### Value Types
- **recorded_current**: Total quantity counted
- **recorded_active**: Functional/in-use items
- **recorded_broken**: Damaged/non-functional items
- **recorded_inactive**: Not in use but functional items
